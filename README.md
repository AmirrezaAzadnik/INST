Project Description: The Smart Farming (IoT) project focuses on the development of an automated system to monitor and control essential farming parameters, optimizing the growth environment for plants and protecting the farm from external disturbances. The system employs various sensors and actuators connected through an Arduino-based microcontroller to enhance farm management efficiency.

The system senses key environmental factors such as air temperature, humidity, light intensity, and the proximity of birds approaching the farm. Sensors used include light sensors, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, and ultrasonic sensors for distance detection. The collected data is processed in real-time to control actuators that maintain ideal conditions for plant growth.

Key features include:

- Climate Control: A fan is activated for heat and humidity regulation when thresholds are exceeded.
Light Management: LEDs are used to supplement natural light to ensure optimal plant growth.
- Bird Deterrence: The system detects birds approaching the farm using an ultrasonic sensor and activates a buzzer to scare them away.

This IoT-enabled smart farming solution automates critical tasks, ensuring better resource utilization and crop protection. It is designed to be an efficient, scalable, and sustainable approach to modern agriculture.
